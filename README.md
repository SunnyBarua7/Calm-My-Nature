# 🌿 Calm My Nature 🎮

**Calm My Nature** is a 3D relaxation game set in a peaceful, natural environment. Built using Unity, this project creates a calming experience featuring trees, terrain, sky, and ambient nature sounds — designed to help users de-stress and immerse themselves in a tranquil digital world.

---

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis at **Nantong University**, with the goal of exploring how digital nature simulations can support **mental well-being**. The game encourages relaxation through immersive visuals, natural soundscapes, and gentle user interaction, serving as a prototype for therapeutic game design.

## 🌲 Features

- 🌳 Beautiful, open 3D nature environment with trees, hills, and skybox
- 🎧 Calming ambient sounds (wind, birds, etc.)
- 🎮 Basic first-person movement system for slow-paced exploration
- 🌄 Simple but immersive visuals for stress relief and mental relaxation
- ❤️ *(Planned)* Integration with **Arduino Uno** and heart rate sensor to adapt the game’s feedback based on real-time stress levels

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🎮 **Game Engine**: Unity (2022.3 or later recommended)
- 💻 **Programming Language**: C#
- 🌐 **3D Assets**: Unity Asset Store / custom-made
- 🔊 **Audio**: Natural ambient sound effects
- 🧩 **Optional Hardware**: Arduino Uno + Heart Rate Sensor for biofeedback

---

## 🔗 Arduino Integration (Planned Feature)

This project will be extended to connect with an **Arduino Uno** and a **heart rate sensor** using serial communication. The goal is to allow the environment (lighting, sound, etc.) to change based on the player's stress level.

**Basic idea:**
- Use Arduino to read heart rate
- Send values to Unity via USB serial
- In Unity, modify visuals/audio based on heart rate

*(This feature is in progress and not yet part of the current build.)*
